        <p>Yeah yeah this movie is good and all, but that’s not what I’m here to talk about. I would just like to acknowledge the character Mort, ya know King Julian’s little companion? Apparently he’s a near-immortal species that can suck out the life force from other “morts” giving him multiple personalities? He’s consumed his grandma’s life force meaning she now lives inside his mind. Apparently she’s been trying to take control of Mort and has already taken control of one of his alter egos Smart Mort. That conflict has been going on for 50 years, so... fun times. He is confirmed Jewish. He’s had at least 11 wives and his entire household is filled with pictures of King Julian’s feet. His father was a bear and he also posses some starfish DNA, which in fact, is enough to where he can grow gills and regenerate his head. He also has some spider DNA and can produce webs. All of this information is 100% canon. Please research for yourself, cause it’s gonna rock your world, truly. I cannot in good conscience give this movie anything lower than a 5 star rating knowing what I know, knowing that Mort is a lovecraft demon that can access other planes of reality but needs a physical avatar in order to do so. Less than 5 stars would be a disservice to the crackheads at Dreamworks who created this little ball of pure evil and chaos.</p>
